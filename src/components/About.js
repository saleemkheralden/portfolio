        I am an <span className="font-bold">AI Engineer</span> at the IDF,
        holding a B.Sc. in Data Science from the Technion. I specialize in the
        full lifecycle of AI systems, from building robust data pipelines
        (ETL/MLOps) to developing and deploying cutting-edge machine learning
        and deep learning models. My background in Data Engineering and
        Algorithms allows me to transform complex, raw data into scalable,
        high-impact intelligent solutions.
